# SOLAR LIGHT #

# Introduction
An improved solar light for your garden or home

# Why this project is useful
Most garden solar lights are designed to be produced as cheaply as possible, are not weather proof and only last a few months. This is very wasteful. This project is for a microprocessor controlled lamp, using a long life Lithium Fero Phosphate battery and should last 10 years or more.

# Getting started
Order the printed curcuit boards and components
Compile the code in this repository, compile it using MPLABX and XC8
Load the compiled code into the miroprocessor
