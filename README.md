# SOLAR LIGHT #

# Introduction
An improved solar light for your garden or home

# Why this project is useful
Most garden solar lights are designed to be produced as cheaply as possible, are not weather proof and only last a few months. This is very wasteful. This project is for a microprocessor controlled lamp, using a long life Lithium Fero Phosphate battery and should last 10 years or more.
